                    This <strong> new competitive program</strong> will have a separate application process and will be supplemental

                      their own scientific question, collect background information, perform an experiment,
                       and report their findings through a <strong>3-5 page report</strong> and

                    coordinate with their teachers to make the project part of a classroom assignment. 
                    We will encourage students to reach out to their teachers to discuss these options.
